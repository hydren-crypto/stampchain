# SRC-BNS Standard

`SRC-BNS` is a bitcoin name service standard which is 100% following [SRC-101](./src101/src101.md), the Non-fungible Token Standard on BTC Stamp.

# Specifications
A normal SRC-BNS transaction must conform to these **required** fields (without **optional** label) or a Bitcoin Stamp Number will not be created, the transaction will not be considered a valid SRC-BNS transaction or even a SRC-101 transaction and they will not appear in the Bitcoin Stamps Protocol index / API.

    "op": "deploy", //(string)function name
    "tick": "Bit Name Service",  //(string)collection name, must be 1-32 characters, can have blank
    "max": "0", //(uint64)0 means unlimited
    "lim": "0", //(uint64)0 means unlimited
    "dec": "0", //(uint8)indivisible NFT
    "owner": "bc1q34eaj4rz9yxupzxwza2epvt3qv2nvcc0ujqqpl", //(string)owner address
    "rec": "bc1q7rwd4cgdvcmrxm27xfy6504jwkllge3dda04ww", //(string)recipient address to receive mint fees

    "desc": "Bitname Service powered by BTC stamp.", //(string)description for the collection.[optional, default=""]
    "mintstart": "1706866958", // Unix timestamps in Milliseconds. Mint is available from this time.
    "mintend": "18446744073709551615", 
    "wlf": true, //(bool)whitelist flag
    "wll": "https://xxxxx", 
    "disc": "50", //(uint8) 50% discount for whitelist address
    "slf": false
}
```

### MINT
```JSON
{
    "p": "src-101", //(string)protocol standard for non-fungible token
    "op": "mint", //(string)function name
    "hash": "0x38091b803f794e50dcc10a9091becaf4f65d35d3ef9e71cfa90c7936af50757e", //(hash256)txid of bns deploy transaction
    "random": false, //(bool)When "random" is false, tokenid is necessary, "amt" is always 1. When "random" is true, "amt" is necessary, tokenid is "";
    "toaddress": "bc1q7rwd4cgdvcmrxm27xfy6504jwkllge3dda04ww", // recipient address of this mint, can be different from the address in vout[0];
    "tokenid": "7375706572626f79", //(string)UTF8-> hexstring: superboy->7375706572626f79. It only works when "random" is false [optional, default= "", means random]
    "amt": "1", //always 1
    "dua": "1"//(uint8)years of duration. Expire date = current + dua
}
```

### TRANSFER
```JSON
{
    "p": "src-101", //(string)protocol standard for non-fungible token
    "op": "transfer", //(string)function name
    "hash": "0x38091b803f794e50dcc10a9091becaf4f65d35d3ef9e71cfa90c7936af50757e", //(hash256)txid of the deploy transaction
    "toaddress": "bc1q7rwd4cgdvcmrxm27xfy6504jwkllge3dda04ww", // new owner address of this token, can be different from the address in vout[0]
    "tokenid": "7375706572626f79" //(uint64)tokenid of this nft
}
```

If the NFT specified to be transferred not in transaction sender's address (which would be determined by the latest state of an Indexer), then the transfer  will be deemed invalid.

### SETRECORD
```JSON
{
    "p": "src-101", //(string)protocol standard for non-fungible token
    "op": "setrecord", //(string)function name
    "hash": "0x38091b803f794e50dcc10a9091becaf4f65d35d3ef9e71cfa90c7936af50757e", //(hash256)txid of the deploy transaction
    "type": "address", //(string)Currently two kinds of record types are supported, txt and address
    "data": "bc1q7epcly9u55yut5k7ykmlcyrp87knt8gxd7knnt", //(string)record data
}
```
Multi record could exist. If the record for setting is existed, it will be overwrote.

### RENEW
```JSON
{
    "p": "src-101", //(string)protocol standard for non-fungible token
    "op": "renew", //(string)function name
    "hash": "0x38091b803f794e50dcc10a9091becaf4f65d35d3ef9e71cfa90c7936af50757e", //(hash256)txid of the deploy transaction
    "address": "bc1q7epcly9u55yut5k7ykmlcyrp87knt8gxd7knnt", //(string)owner address
    "tokenid": "7375706572626f79", //(string)UTF8-> hexstring
    "dua": "2" //(uint8)years of duration. Expire date = current + dua
}
```

### TRANSFEROWNERSHIP
```JSON
{
    "p": "src-101", //(string)protocol standard for non-fungible token
    "op": "transferownership", //(string)function name, this function only works when "slf" of "deploy" is true
    "hash": "0x38091b803f794e50dcc10a9091becaf4f65d35d3ef9e71cfa90c7936af50757e", //(hash256)txid of the deploy transaction
    "newowner": "bc1qag3cemd7988sgtx2huscdf6qmvgexnsx393ayc" //(string)new owner address.Support any existed type of bitcoin addresses
}
```
This allows src-101 admin transferring ownership to another. Only owner address can invoke "SETPROPERTY", "SETMETADATA" and "TRANSFEROWNERSHIP".
