# SRC-101 Standard

`SRC-101` is a unique non-fungible token  standard only for bitcoin name service based on BTC Stamp. It's inherited from [SRC-20](./src20.md) and compatible with that. In SRC-101, tokens will bind with owner accounts and can never been mistakenly spent with UTXOs which greatly prevents asset loss. It also enables multi transfer op in 1 transaction. This can reduce much more network fees. 

# Specifications
A normal SRC-101 transaction must conform to these fields. Otherwise a Bitcoin Stamp Number will not be created, the transaction will not be considered a valid SRC-101 transaction and they will not appear in the Bitcoin Stamps Protocol index / API. 

### DEPLOY
```JSON
{
    "p": "src-101", //(string)protocol standard name for bitname service
    "op": "deploy", //(string)function name
    "tick": "Bit Name Service",  //(string)collection name
    "max": "0", //(uint64)0 means unlimited
    "lim": "0", //(uint64)0 means unlimited
    "dec": "0", //(uint8)indivisible NFT
    "owner": "bc1q34eaj4rz9yxupzxwza2epvt3qv2nvcc0ujqqpl", //(string)owner address
    "rec": "bc1q7rwd4cgdvcmrxm27xfy6504jwkllge3dda04ww", //(string)recipient address to receive mint fees
    "sym": "BNS", //(string)symbol
    "pri": "30769", //(uint64)price in sats, must pay to "rec"
    "desc": "Bitname Service powered by BTC stamp.", //(string)description for the collection.
    "mintstart": "1706866958", // Unix timestamps in Milliseconds. Mint is available from this time.
    "mintend": "18446744073709551615", // Maximum Unix timestamps 
    "wlf": true, //(bool)whitelist flag
    "wll": "https://xxxxx", 
    "disc": "50", //(uint8) 50% discount for whitelist address
    "slf": false
}
```
The `DEPLOY` transaction signer must be the same as "owner", otherwise it will not be considered as a valid SRC-101 transaction. 

### MINT
```JSON
{
    "p": "src-101", //(string)protocol standard name
    "op": "mint", //(string)function name
    "hash": "0x38091b803f794e50dcc10a9091becaf4f65d35d3ef9e71cfa90c7936af50757e", //(hash256)txid of bns deploy transaction
    "toaddress": "bc1q7rwd4cgdvcmrxm27xfy6504jwkllge3dda04ww", // recipient address of this mint, can be different from signer address.
    "tokenid": "7375706572626f79", //(string)UTF8-> hexstring: superboy->7375706572626f79.
    "amt": "1", //always 1
    "dua": "1"//(uint8)years of duration. Expire date = current + dua
}
```

### TRANSFER
```JSON
{
    "p": "src-101", //(string)protocol standard name
    "op": "transfer", //(string)function name
    "hash": "0x38091b803f794e50dcc10a9091becaf4f65d35d3ef9e71cfa90c7936af50757e", //(hash256)txid of the deploy transaction, only this txid will be considered as valid in bitname service.
    "toaddress": "bc1q7rwd4cgdvcmrxm27xfy6504jwkllge3dda04ww", // new owner address of this token..Support any existed type of bitcoin addresses
    "tokenid": "7375706572626f79" //
}
```

If the bitname NFT specified to be transferred not in transaction sender's address (which would be determined by the latest state of an Indexer), then the transfer  will be deemed invalid.

### SETRECORD
```JSON
{
    "p": "src-101", //(string)protocol standard name
    "op": "setrecord", //(string)function name
    "hash": "0x38091b803f794e50dcc10a9091becaf4f65d35d3ef9e71cfa90c7936af50757e", //(hash256)txid of the deploy transaction
    "type": "address", //(string)Currently two kinds of record types are supported, txt and address
    "data": "bc1q7epcly9u55yut5k7ykmlcyrp87knt8gxd7knnt", //(string)record data
}
```
The `SETRECORD` transaction signer must be the same as "owner", otherwise it will not be considered as a valid SRC-101 transaction. 
Multi record could exist for different addresses. If the record for setting is existed, it will be overwrote.

### RENEW
```JSON
{
    "p": "src-101", //(string)protocol standard for non-fungible token
    "op": "renew", //(string)function name
    "hash": "0x38091b803f794e50dcc10a9091becaf4f65d35d3ef9e71cfa90c7936af50757e", //(hash256)txid of the deploy transaction
    "address": "bc1q7epcly9u55yut5k7ykmlcyrp87knt8gxd7knnt", //(string)owner address
    "tokenid": "7375706572626f79", //(string)UTF8-> hexstring
    "dua": "2" //(uint8)years of duration. Expire date = current + dua
}
```

### TRANSFEROWNERSHIP
```JSON
{
    "p": "src-101", //(string)protocol standard for non-fungible token
    "op": "transferownership", //(string)function name
    "hash": "0x38091b803f794e50dcc10a9091becaf4f65d35d3ef9e71cfa90c7936af50757e", //(hash256)txid of the deploy transaction
    "newowner": "bc1qag3cemd7988sgtx2huscdf6qmvgexnsx393ayc" //(string)new owner address.Support any existed type of bitcoin addresses
}
```
This allows src-101 admin transferring ownership to another. The `TRANSFEROWNERSHIP` transaction signer must be the same as "owner", otherwise it will not be considered as a valid SRC-101 transaction.
